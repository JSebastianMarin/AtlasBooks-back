# AtlasBooks - Legacy Branch

🚨 **Notice: This branch contains the legacy version of the AtlasBooks project.** 🚨  
This version was developed during the **Software Development 1** class as an academic project. While it served as a foundation, the current project has been **entirely refactored** and **enhanced with new functionalities** to better align with our long-term vision and technical skills.

We’ve decided to preserve this branch as a snapshot of our journey to show how much we’ve grown as developers. It stands as a testament to the progress we've made in both **frontend** and **backend** development.

## About the Legacy Version

AtlasBooks is a web application inspired by Z-Library, aimed at empowering users to:

- 📚 Upload, download, and explore books freely.
- ✍️ Comment on and rate books to foster a community-driven platform.

This version was built using the **PERN stack** (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js) and reflects the skills and knowledge we acquired during our earlier academic journey.
